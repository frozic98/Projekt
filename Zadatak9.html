        <h3>We are Rimac</h3>
        <p>We design, engineer and build the most advanced automotive technology possible. From developing and manufacturing era-defining hypercars to inventing and building ground-breaking new technologies. We challenge convention and push technology to the edge of possibility. Welcome to Rimac. This is our story.
        <h3>Forging the future, faster</h3>
        <p>Rimac Automobili was founded in 2009 from a love for automotive and with the vision to create high-performance cars for the electric era. Today, we're a 1300-people strong technology powerhouse focused on designing, engineering and producing electric hypercars and high-performance EV components for the global automotive industry.</p>
        <h3>Our vision</h3>
        <p>Our goal is to show the world amazing engineering through our electric hypercars and advanced technologies. But it wasn't always like that. The original idea was to create the most powerful (electric) hypercar. However, the technology we needed didn't exist yet and the systems that were available simply weren't available to us an automotive startup back in 2009. It was clear we had to create everything ourselves. Ever since, we've been growing the talent and core competencies in-house.</p>
